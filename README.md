Corne Keyboard workspace and hub

This is sort of a reintroduction process for me to work on coding in my free time and as a secondary to the keeb hobby.
Generally, I have little coding experience, and what I do have is limited to C++
Goals:
-Comfort in using GitHub for software edits
-Confidence in comprehensively understanding not just keyboard construction, but how they work
-OLED design
